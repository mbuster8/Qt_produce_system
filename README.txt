Produce system is an artificial inteligence application which purpose is to deduct some new facts from the set of given facts using particular given rules.
In this application we firstly choose suitable facts and match their variables. If all the variables of a given rule are matched and they meet all the conditions of a given rule, we map variables of the facts to the variables of the rule and we create a new instance of the rule. This new instance is joined to the queue if instances waiting for evaluation. After cheching all the given rules and creating all the possoble instances we start to evaluate these instances. All the new evaluated instances are then compared with already evaluated instances waiting in a queue for execution. If an instance already exist in the queue of the instances waiting for execution, we get rid of it. We are also checking whether the new instance is not adding to the set of rules a fact which already is there or is not deleting something which is not in there. Filtered instances are finally enqueued ti the queue of instances waiting for execution. In each step of the program, only one instance of the rule with actions it carries is executed.
